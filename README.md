# ALU-design-in-VHDL-using-DE1-SOC-FPGA-kit
Embedded Systems project in which I coded an interface for a 4-bit ALU, 3-bit binary counter, and three 7-segment displays in VHDL to be uploaded and mapped to I/O on a DE1-SOC FPGA board. 

I designed the components for a working 4-bit ALU in a previous project however for this project I decided to start with a skeleton containing ALU code provided by my teacher.

The ALU is capable of several different arithmetic and logical operations using the 4-bit Opcode and two 4-bit binary inputs A and B.

The binary counter was used in combination with a button on the FPGA board to represent 3 bits of the Opcode. A switch was used to represent the other Opcode bit which was the Carry In.
